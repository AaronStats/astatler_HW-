Web Forms

- For this project, we were tasked with creating a web form in order to gain insight on activities of undergraduate students. I used this prompt to create a in-depth, survey in which users would input their name, age, grade, email and interests in order to gain insight for the survey. 
- My web form conforms to the best practices of HTML, CSS and general use. I used semantic HTML elements like form, label, input, select, textarea, etc. to structure my form in a way that is easy to understand and use. I also provided clear and concise labels, I made sure to label my form fields clearly and concisely, so users know what information is required. Labels should be placed adjacent to their respective form fields. I used form validation to ensure that users enter the correct information in each field. Validation can be implemented using HTML attributes like required, pattern, min, max, etc. Also made sure my form is accessible to all users, including those who use assistive technologies. I used the label element to associate each form field with its label, and used aria-describedby to provide additional context or guidance.
